    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "So I'm finally on the verge of purchasing a next generation console and I can't wait to start playing all the great games that I've missed out on since I stopped the hobby in 2013. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the trouble is, a lot of remarkable games have come out but I only have the time to play a few. Moreover, I'm well aware that certain games are platform exclusives, so I'll have to decide on the platform that will provide me the best value. \n",
    "\n",
    "At first I figured these questions should be fairly easy to answer by visiting the various video game news sites Sure enough there are plenty of lists but each publisher seems to have a different curation of games. How do I decide on which list to trust and what games to play? Turns out that there are several approaches, each with it's own issues. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- I could just follow the list provided by the site that ranks first on Google. However, this would give me a biased view since any single view on subjective matters such as the best video games to play is likely to be inferior to an aggregate view. Moreover, list may itself be contradictory with the scores provided by the reviewer For example, in [IGN's list](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-100-video-games-of-all-time), [Dark Souls](https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/09/30/dark-souls-review) which had received a 9 is ranked above [Person 5 Royal](https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-5-royal-review) which was rated a 10 by IGN. According to the site, the list reflects the views of the current staff which might be different to the ones who had originally reviewed the game and takes into account several qualitative factors such as how fun the game is to play today vs how great it was when it had launched, and to what extent the game is the very best in its class. This is not a bad approach to building a list but it does add significant bias. \n",
    "\n",
    "- I could compare multiple lists and only factor in the games that lie in the intersection of these lists. This approach should give me a less biased view, but to do this process manually would be painstaking.\n",
    "\n",
    "- I could just view the top games on a review aggregation platform like [Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/browse/games/score/metascore/all/all/filtered) and filter it out by date and platform. On the surface, this should give me the least biased answers, but unfortunately this is not the case. [Metacritic] adds a hidden weight to each of the critics that they are aggregating, thus adding a hidden bias to the score. Isn't there a way for me to do better? \n",
